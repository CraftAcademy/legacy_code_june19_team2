Feature: Forgotten Password
    As a user,
    In order to help me remember my CA Mailboxer Account Password,
    I would like to have a "Forgot Password" option to help me retrieve my forgotten password

Background:
    Given the following user exists
    | email        | password   | name |
    | john@doe.com | password1  | John |
    And I visit the site
    And I click "Login"
    And I click "Forgot your password?"
    And I should see "Forgot your password?"

Scenario: If user forgets password they can request it to be recovered (happy path)
    And I fill "Email" with "john@doe.com"
    And I click "Send me reset password instructions"
    Then I should see "You will receive an email with instructions on how to reset your password in a few minutes."
